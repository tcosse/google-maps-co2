This project is under development. The website in production can be found here : https://my-google-maps-co2.osc-fr1.scalingo.io/

The objective is to create a website to analyse your Google Location History in order to calculate the carbon footprint of your trips.

If you're a Google Maps user, Google can store and analyse your location data (if you've activated your location history, which is deactivated by default).
Google computes all your different itineraries and the type of transportation you used (car, bike, walk, plane, boat...).
You can view your google maps location history using [Google Maps Timeline](https://timeline.google.com/maps/timeline).

You can export this data using [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/) : check location history, and then upload the zip file to the website.

If you have any feedback, feel free to contact me !
